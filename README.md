# Note Taker Application

## Description

This project is a note taker application that allows you to write notes, save them, and delete them. All note data is saved on the back end using JSON. You can access notes at any time, and the JSON file will update in real time.

I learned a lot about get, post, and delete requests using Express. I also learned a lot about routing. This project was full circle for me, as I had to learn how to manipulate front and back end code, and make them work together. It was a valuable learning experience.

## Installation

You don't need to install this project. Just visit the deployed application on Heroku (need link)

## Usage

You can visit the deployed application here (need link) and create your notes by clicking the "Get Started" button. From there, you can type in your note title and text, and click the Save button in the top right. You can access all your notes by clicking them on the left-hand side, and delete them by pressing the Trashcan button.
